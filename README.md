# CWLink - Simple linker for AmigaOS

Copyright (c) 2016, Constantin Wiemer

CWLink is a simple linker for the AmigaOS written in Python, based on the Amiga Hunk format for executables and object files. I wrote it just for educational purposes and fun, so it has only very limited functionality and will for sure contain bugs.
